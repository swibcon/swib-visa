Dear Mrs Müntefering,

For ten years now, the SWIB ("Semantic Web in Libraries") conference has brought together a community of experts and scientists from the field of libraries and other heritage institutions with the aim of linking cultural assets on the World Wide Web using linked data technologies. SWIB (http://swib.org) takes place every year in Germany (alternating between Hamburg and Cologne/Bonn), with 150 to 180 participants from around 25 different countries each year.

SWIB started in 2009 as a small German-language conference and over the years has transformed itself into an English-language, international conference with a formative influence in our field. Involving many different and international participants in the annual event is essential for a strong community and the quality of our projects, research and applications.

As a program committee, we therefore actively try to expand the circle of speakers and participants beyond the already well represented regions of origin Europe and North America. In doing so, however, we encounter obstacles due to the visa policy of the Federal Foreign Office and the Schengen area. Their handling of this policy by the consulate in Lagos prevented Nigerian experts from participating in SWIB in 2018.

At the end of June, we had selected from a large number of submissions those that were to be presented to SWIB. Two lecturers, Babarinde Ayodeji Odewumi (Abba & King Systems LLC) and Adetoun Adebisi Oyelude (University of Ibadan) from Nigeria were to present their work "Supporting LCSH subject indexing with LOD in a Nigerian university library", which dealt, among other things, with the special challenges in developing countries. Six weeks before the conference, the two speakers started to apply for their visas. Invitation letters had been sent by the University Library Centre of North Rhine-Westphalia as the local organiser; Ms Oyelude's participation in the conference was also supported by a grant from the BI International programme of the Federal Association of German Library and Information Associations.

After a strenuous process and despite personal support from the chairman of the programme committee from Cologne and a supporting fax from BI-International, both visa applications were rejected. Frustrating was, among other things, the impersonal, not helpful communication, using pre-formulated phrases, where partly important information was not given to us and partly information already given by us was ignored. At the conference at the end of November, the speakers were only able to make their contribution in a technically limited video transmission. The conference participants were very alineated by the reasons for that process.

This specific case has alarmed us and also prompted us to take a closer look at the registered but non-attended participants of recent years. Of the 23 registered persons in 2014, 2016 and 2018 from countries that require a Schengen visa, only seven attended SWIB. We now assume that here, too, the refusal of a visa was among the reasons for not being able to take part.

We ask you for:

- Your support of conferences and other events in the field of science and culture for building as diverse a participation as possible.
- The support of applicants in the application process by the embassies and consulates instead of hindering the process by time-consuming enquiries and withholding of important information.

With this letter, we would like to bring the problems to your attention and hope for your support for international cultural and scientific exchange and cooperation, especially with researchers who are subject to a restrictive visa policy due to their origin.

Yours sincerely on behalf of the members of the SWIB Programme Committee
Adrian Pohl
