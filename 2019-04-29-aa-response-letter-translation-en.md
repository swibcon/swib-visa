Dear Mr Pohl,

thank you very much for your letter from April 10th, also in the name of the members of the SWIB programme committee, where you explain the activities of "Semantic Web in Libraries".

I regret that at the last conference there were misunderstandings regarding visa application. It is important too for the "Auswärtiges Amt" (Foreign Office) to support scholarly and cultural exchange. It goes without saying that not only participants from Europe and North America should be able to attend. Let me therefore shortly explain regarding the visa process:

Visa applications for short-term stays are carefully examined by foreign representations in accordance with standardized European regulations of the Community Code on Visas. The Visa Code standardizes the requirements for visa acceptance, whose presence has to be checked by foreign representations during the visa process. Besides evidence for the plausability of the travel purpose and possession of sufficient financial means to cover travel and living expenses as well as adequate health insurance cover, applicants must also present a credible return perspective to their home country.

For major events and conferences, Auswärtiges Amt's head office offers to flank participants' visa procedure, especially by early information of the responsible visa centers. Under certain circumstances, for example presentation of various original documents that are usually required in the process, may be dispensed.

Nevertheless, the Auswärtiges Amt's head office's support during the process does not replace the actual visa process, i.e. guests must seek for appointments in a timely manner and must present full applications. The decision about individual visa applications is made by the respective visa center in accordance with relevant laws.

For additional questions about the visa process, you can address the responsible department of Auswärtiges Amt, a leaflet about the process is attached.

Best regards
Michelle Müntefering.
